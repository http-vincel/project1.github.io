# Caesar's Encryption and Decryption

Caesar's cipher is one of the oldest cryptographic algorithms, a monoalphabetic substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a letter that is a fixed number of positions ahead in the alphabet (the "key"), for example with a key of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E. Devised by Julius Caesar for military communications, it is simple to use but today easily broken by frequency analysis or brute force.
